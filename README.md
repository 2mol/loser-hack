# Loser-Hack

<sub>when? Friday, September 15 to Sunday, September 17, 2017</sub>

<sub>where? Juri's Living Room near Haldenegg</sub>

## why/what?

Did Hack Zurich (just like your parents) not want you?

- because you didn't notice that you had to send your CV, a handwritten motivational letter, and erotic fanfiction featuring the the all-male cast of the Jury in a sensual yet tasteful tropical island setting? (mentioned on the registration page, go look it up)
- because the only language choices were Java and PHP (list recited purely from memory)
- because you're not an "idea person"
- because you don't blockchain, and machine learning is soo 2015

In short:

- because you're just **not very cool**

You're just a total LOSER. And now your feelings are hurt.

But **wait**, now there's a solution! Get together with other losers in a completely uncompetitive environment where EVERYBODY WINS A PRICE.
