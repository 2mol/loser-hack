# Loser-Hack

<sub>when? Friday, September 15 to Sunday, September 17, 2017</sub>

<sub>where? Juri's living room near Haldenegg</sub>

## why/what?

Did Hack Zurich (just like your parents) not want you?

- because you didn't notice that you had to send your CV, a handwritten motivational letter, and erotic fanfiction featuring the the all-male cast of the Jury in a sensual yet tasteful tropical island setting? (mentioned on the registration page, go look it up)
- because the only language choices were Java and PHP 4 (list recited purely from memory)
- because you're not an "idea person"
- because you don't blockchain, and machine learning is soo 2015

In short:

- because you're just **not very cool**

You're just a total LOSER. And now your feelings are hurt.

But **wait**, now there's a solution! Get together with other losers in a completely uncompetitive environment where EVERYBODY WINS A PRIZE.

## FAQ

#### Q: Is there a bathroom?
A: Yes, it's the door on the right of the kitchen

#### Q: What if I don’t know how to program?
A: Two options: 1) Hang with us and we'll teach you stuff! 2) Use the fully equipped woodworking shop in my bedroom and build your own furniture (please note I only have Ash, a little bit of Oak and what I think is Elm (no relation to the programming language; but HEY, let's learn some Elm, it looks FUN) on stock, but it should be enough for a coffee table or a couple of chairs. Also, we don't have an ambulance on-call, but the Waid Hospital is close by and very easy to get to, even via Uber. But we're drifting a bit off-topic here, so back to computer stuff).

#### Q: Which languages
A: Come and do C, Haskell, Plankalkül, Ruby, Visual Basic, we don't give a shit! No judgement, everything goes!

#### Q: What am I supposed to do there?
A: Work on anything! Have a coffee! Make friends! Work by yourself in a corner and avoid making eye contact with anyone!

#### Q: How can I sign up?
A: xx email address here xx

#### Q: Do you have those rooms where you can retreat to do thinking and brainstorming or Yoga?
A: No. Yes. Sort of. My flatmate Maria got accepted into the actual Hack Zurich, so you can use her room. It is very empty and might seem like the den of a heroin-addict at first glance, but I promise she's cool and she just likes it that way, because of the way she is, not because of heroin.

#### Q: Is this 40 hours non-stop and can I sleep at your place?
A: No

#### Q: Swag?
A: No.
